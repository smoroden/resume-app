# Resume App

## Notes
* There should probably be more UI Tests but there are some. I need to learn more about best practices surrounding them.
* It would have been nice to get more of the data on the screen like profile image and just more detail in the various screens like education. Time just didn't allow it.
* Would have been nice to use RxSwift but my understanding was no libraries of any kind.
* Like I noted in the code I exposed a mock object to the app target for ui testing. Not sure I like that but it does achieve what I want (consistency on app launch for ui tests)
* I also wanted to add a custom transition between the home view and each page
* One thing missing from it being "Production Ready" is the lack of architechture diagrams
